----------
Spearmint Virtual Machine (SVM) is a specification for a software program
that executes code and provides the runtime environment for that code.

It is a process virtual machine meaning that it allows a single process to
run as an application on a host machine, providing a platform-independent
programming environment by masking the information of the underlying hardware
or operating system.

Specificaton:
The SVM takes in bytecode and executes it according to the defined instruction 
set.
