PROGRAM_FAIL	- Terminate the program with a generic error message

PUSH - Pushes an element to the stack
	1st byte after = datatype
	2nd - nth byte = data

POP - Pops an element from the stack

COPY - Places a copy of the top most element on stack. No elements are popped

ADD - Pops two elements from top of stack and places the result of addition
SUB - Pops two elements from top of stack and places the result of subtraction
MUL - Pops two elements from top of stack and places the result of multiplication
DIV - Pops two elements from top of stack and places the result of division
MOD - Pops two elements from top of stack and places the remainer of division

EQ - Pops two elements from top of stack and places a value representing their equivalence by type, value or address
NEQ - Pops two elements from top of stack and places a value representing their inequivalence by type, value and address
CMP - Pops top two elements on the stack and pushes a value containing the result of comparison 
	  (a numerical value describing the difference between the two elements)

PRINT - Pops element and prints without newline
PRINTLN - Pops element and prints with newline

JUMP - Performs an unconditional jump to address of bytecode[offset] stored in the following 4 bytes
JLTZ - Pops element from stack and conditionally jump to address of bytecode[offset], if value < 0
JEZ  - Pops element from stack and conditionally jump to address of bytecode[offset], if value == 0
JGTZ - Pops element from stack and conditionally jump to address of bytecode[offset], if value > 0

CALL - Pops element from stack and calls function mapped to string value in lookup table
BENCHMARK - Set the reportBenchmark flag to true and tracks time until program terminates successfully
